### Summary
Due to the environmental and socio‐economic importance of mountainous regions, it is crucial to understand causes and consequences of climatic changes in those sensitive landscapes. Daily resolution alpine climate data from Switzerland covering an elevation range of over 3,000 m between 1981 and 2017 have been analysed using highly resolved trends in order to gain a better understanding of features, forcings and feedbacks related to temperature changes in mountainous regions. Particular focus is put on processes related to changes in weather types, incoming solar radiation, cloud cover, air humidity, snow/ice and elevation dependency of temperature trends.
