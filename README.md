Elevation-dependent warming in the Swiss Alps: features, forcings and feedbacks

This repository stores R code used for analyzing alpine climate data from Switzerland using average trend statistics to address the following research questions: 
- Are temperatures in Switzerland changing at a different rate depending on elevation?
- What are underlying driving mechanisms of elevation dependent temperature changes?

Within this context, we place special attention on mechanisms related to changes in incoming solar radiation, cloud cover, air humidity, snow cover and large-scale circulation. 

The code comes in form of an R package. For the usage within R use the install_gitub function from the devtools package:
```R
install_github("ERottler/alptempr")
```
