Elevation-dependent warming in the Swiss Alps: features, forcings and feedbacks

R package for the analysis of alpine climatological data using moving average trend statistics.

This repository stores the code used for analyzing alpine climate data from Switzerland to address the following research questions: 
- Are temperatures in Switzerland changing at a different rate depending on elevation?
- What are underlying driving mechanisms of elevation dependent temperature changes?

Within this context, we place special attention on mechanisms related to changes in incoming solar radiation, cloud cover, air humidity, snow cover and large-scale circulation.
